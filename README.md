```kotlin
// Version sample from the web service.
version = Version(
    "1.2.3",
    "https://picsum.photos/200/300", //An image just for sample.

        |- Add profile photo.
        |- New fancy fonts.
        """.trimMargin()
)
        
checkVersion(
    activity = this,
    version = version!!,
    title = "New Version",

        allGrant = false
        break
    }
    if (allGrant) when (requestCode) {
        VERSION_REQUEST_CODE_W_EXT_STORAGE -> {
            version?.let { ver ->
                downloadVersion(
                    context = this,
                    downloadURL = ver.url,
                    title = getString(R.string.app_name),
                    description = getString(com.jesusd0897.versionify.R.string.version_downloading)
                        + " " + version!!.versionName,
                    downloadWay = DownloadWay.DOWNLOAD_MANAGER

            }
